# Ansible

Ansible is a modern IT automation tool which makes your life easier by managing your servers for you.
You just need to define the configuration in which you are interested and ansible will go ahead and
do it for you, be it installing a package or configuring a server application or even restarting a
service. Ansible is always ready to manage your servers.{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Ansible manages machines in an agent-less manner. You do not need to have anything installed on the clientâ€™s end.
However both push and pull mode are supported. Ansible is a security focused tool. It uses OpenSSH as transport
protocol. Ansible scripts (commonly known as playbooks) are written in YAML and are easy to read.{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
